<h1><tt>carpal</tt> Futures overview</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The central class of the <em>carpal futures</em> mechanism is the template class
<a href="promise-future-pair.html"><tt>carpal::PromiseFuturePair&lt;T&gt;</tt></a>. This is an object that will receive the return value
of an asynchronous operation upon its completion. It may also receive an exception, if the asynchronous operation throws.</p>

<p><tt>carpal::PromiseFuturePair&lt;T&gt;</tt> allows to:<ul>
  <li>check whether the operation has completed or not and, if completed, whether it returned a value or threw an exception;
  <li>retrieve the returned value or the exception, if completed;
  <li>wait for completion;
  <li>enqueue an operation &mdash; called <em>continuation</em> &mdash; to be executed when the asynchronous operation completes;
  <li>declare the asynchronous operation complete by specifying the returned value or the exception.
</ul>

<p>The consumer &mdash; the caller of the asynchronous operation &mdash; typically receive a <a href="future.html"><tt>carpal::Future&lt;T&gt;</tt></a>,
which is essentially a wrapper over a <tt>std::shared_ptr&lt;PromiseFuturePair&lt;T&gt;&nbsp;&gt;</tt>. A <tt>carpal::Future&lt;T&gt;</tt>
offers access to the consumer facing operations of the <tt>carpal::PromiseFuturePair</tt>,
plus some methods allowing to compose asynchronous operations.

<p>Some of those methods involve executing code on an <a href="executor.html">executor</a> mechanism.

<p>On the other hand, <a href="promise.html"><tt>carpal::Promise&lt;T&gt;</tt></a> is, similarly, a wrapper over a
<tt>std::shared_ptr&lt;PromiseFuturePair&lt;T&gt;&nbsp;&gt;</tt> giving access to its producer facing methods.

<p>There are also <a href="future-standalone.html">stand-alone functions</a> related to futures.
